- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Van
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning how to code and computational biology/bioinformatics
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python
- Follow me on this journey to learning how to code using Python as a complete noob. 
- I am starting these "projects" by following/replicating along other projects just to become familiar with coding. 
- If you have any suggestions or advice on how to improve, please feel free to reach out to me and talk!
